;;; Commentary:

;; With package-spec.el you can specify what package.el sources and
;; packages you want. When starting Emacs all packages specified in
;; the gemfile will be installed if not already, and loaded.
;;
;; To install:
;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/package-spec")
;;   (require 'package-spec)

;;; Code:

(require 'package)

(defvar package-spec-file-name "package-spec.el"
  "Name of package spec file.")

(defvar package-spec-packages ()
  "List of packages defined in package spec.")

(defun package-spec-install ()
  "Install packages specified in `package-spec-file-name'."
  (interactive)
  (dolist (package package-spec-packages)
    (unless (package-installed-p package)
      (message "Installing %s" (symbol-name package))
      (package-install package))))

(defun package-spec-load ()
  "Load `package-spec-file-name'."
  (let ((package-spec (expand-file-name package-spec-file-name "~/.emacs.d")))
    (if (file-exists-p package-spec)
        (load package-spec)
      (error "Missing package spec file."))))

(defun package-spec-reload ()
  "Reloads spec file and run installer."
  (interactive)
  (package-spec-clear)
  (package-spec-load)
  (package-spec-install))

(defun package-spec-clear ()
  "Clear current list of packages."
  (setq package-spec-packages ()))

(defun source (name url)
  "Add package source with NAME and URL."
  (add-to-list 'package-archives `(,name . ,url) t))

(defun package (name)
