# what

These are my dotfiles.

# why

It's easier to just `cp -r files ~/` than to have to remember everything everytime I switch distros

# usage

I've recently moved to Debian, so some of the aliases might be a little funky.  Though if you're interested in forking the files:

```
git clone git@github.com:kellydunn/dotfiles
cd path/to/dotfiles
cp -r dir_i_want ~/
```

# updates

Only as needed, trying to have a minimal setup as possible
